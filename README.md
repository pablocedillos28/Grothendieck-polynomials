# Grothendieck-polynomials
In this project, we write the implementation code to compute Type A Grothendieck polynomials using the degenerate the Hecke algebra as first proposed by Fomin and Kirillov in their paper "Grothendieck polynomials and the Yang-Baxter equation". 
In the code's last section "Example", you can compute the Grothendieck polynomial, \mathfrak{G}_v, with index permutation v = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_m) simply by changing the permutation (1,5,3,2,4) to the permutation v = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_m) and the value 5 to m.
